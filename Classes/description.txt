[quote=About this mod]One more mod that is the result of many suggestions on the request thread :)
Making the goat drop money was not really hard, just some reuse of the Gold Farmer cash. And for the "fake cash" item I simply created a copy of the one you can find everywhere in the City Bay map ^^
The "feign death" ability was also already existing (used by the Rouge power), so I only added a way to trigger it manually.
And finally the explosives (the most fun part :p) caused some problems, but I solved them patiently one by one. At the beginning, I was planning to add only a precise list of explosive objects and the ability to select one of them, but while testing I accidentally found a solution for the problem of objects copies (I tried to do that already in the Cloning Goat mod). So instead of adding a list of objects, I just made it possible to create an explosive that is the copy of any object you lick :D
